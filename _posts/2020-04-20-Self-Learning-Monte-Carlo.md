The final project for the University of Waterloo's Machine Learning in the Physical 
Sciences class was to recreate the results of a research paper of our choosing. My team
chose the paper [Self-Learning Monte Carlo Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03137). Working 
in a team of four we recreated an algorithm that updates states in a monte carlo ising simulation.
The algorithm outperforms traditional local or wolff/cluster updates at and near phase transitions.
