The term project for Waterloo's Introduction to the Implementation of Quantum Information Processing 
was to right a small literature review around a paper on your choosing. I choose to write about the paper
Quantum Cryptography with Entangled Photons. My paper can be found [here](https://github.com/AlecCooper/AlecCooper.github.io/blob/master/assets/Term%20Paper.pdf)!
