ShakespeareTranslator is a personal project that uses a seq2seq language model in Tensorflow to create translations between modern and shakespearean english. A dataset was created by scraping a website with the python libraries beautiful soup and selenium. This dataset was cleaned, parsed, tokenized and embedded to be fed into a language model. The language model is built in tensorflow and is a seq2seq model with an attention mechanism.
