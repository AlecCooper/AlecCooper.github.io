Inuktitut-Detect is a personal project that uses LSTMs and convolutional neural networks to classify words 
between english and inuktitut. The project was built to learn more about NLP and experiment with the Inuktitut 
Parallel Corpus.  

## A Brief Intro To Inuktitut
Inuktitut is the language of Canada’s Inuit, the indigenous group whose traditional lands spread across the 
cold and pristine area above the treeline of Labrador, Quebec, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. 
Inuktitut is a diverse language with a number of dialects across different regions. 
There is a relatively low number of native Inuktitut speakers with just around 35000 
individuals reporting it as their mother tongue.  

The relatively small number of speakers, among other challenges has contributed to relatively few Inuktitut computing 
resources being available. Research into inuktitut NLP is even sparser, with just a few papers 
being written on the topic. (Although these papers are very interesting!)  

My personal interest in Inuktitut NLP comes from a number of places. In the summer of 2019 I had the wonderful 
opportunity of working in one of Frontier College’s indegenous summer literacy camps in the Inuit community of 
Inukjuak. After camp, while doing some random googling about Inuktitut I stumbled upon 
[The Nunavut Hansard Parallel Corpus](https://www.inuktitutcomputing.ca/NunavutHansard/info.php). 
This english-inuktitut corpus seemed like a perfect dataset to base some rudimentary projects upon as a way of 
learning more about natural language processing!
