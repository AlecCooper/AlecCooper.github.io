subtitle: Physics grad with a keen interest in ML
---

I received my bachelorâ€™s of science in physics from the University of Waterloo in 2020. I have a keen interest in machine learning, in particular natural language processing and machine vision. I have developed a number of projects during and after my time at Waterloo which you can checkout on this site!

Outside of academics I have an insatiable appetite for the outdoors. I am an avid runner (former member of UW varsity track and field team), hiker and rock climber.
